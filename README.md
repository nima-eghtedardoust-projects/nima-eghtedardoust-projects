Hey, I’m Nima 👋
Honestly? I’m just someone who's really into building things that matter to me, figuring out tech as I go, and trying to make sense of what’s possible with AI, data, and a bit of code. Not here to sell a polished image—just sharing what I’m working on, learning, and (hopefully) getting better at along the way.

👨‍🔧 What I’m Up To
Turning Ideas Into Tools: I make things that solve problems—some for work, some for fun, and some because they help people around me. Right now, that looks like:

Building tools for product analysis and optimization (for family businesses and friends who need it).
Creating PWAs that help Iranian users navigate international shopping without needing to be tech experts.
Setting up local AI models, mostly for the challenge of it and because I want to see what these models can actually do outside the cloud.
Making Sense of AI: I’m fascinated by what AI can do but don’t have the luxury of a formal background in programming. I dive in with what I know, ask for help when I’m stuck, and learn as I go. My setup is a mix of Docker, local models, and an evolving understanding of GPU and resource management.

📈 Why I Keep Going
I guess it's curiosity that drives me—about tech, about people, and about finding some sense of connection between the two. I like building solutions that feel genuine, that people actually find useful, and that maybe even make their lives a bit easier.

🤔 Where I’m Headed (Maybe)
Honestly? No grand plans. But I’d like to:

See if some of the tools I build can be monetized. They started as personal projects, but I’m open to what they could become.
Get better at bridging what I know and what I want to learn. There's a lot in tech that feels out of reach, but I’m chipping away at it bit by bit.
🎹 Other Things I Love
Music: When I'm not working, I’m usually at the piano or messing around with my keyboard, creating soundtracks that feel as personal as the projects I build.
Poetry & Stories: A sucker for anything with emotional weight. It’s not always obvious, but those things sneak into my projects.
Hands-On Experiments: Whether it's hooking up an reactive lightbars, setting up custom Wi-Fi actions, or trying out random gadgets, I love the DIY life.
📬 Reach Out
If you’re working on something interesting (or if you’re figuring it out as you go like me), let’s connect. I’m open to collaborations, swapping ideas, or just having real conversations about tech and life.
